
OnlineDoctor! is a Plaform written using J2EE for Patients to buy medicine and channel doctors. Doctors can also register under this plaform
to give their service. The website uses a Rule-Base-System to map patients to respective doctors by giving the symptoms of the 
medical condition they have.
